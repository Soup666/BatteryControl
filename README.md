# BatteryControl
A very simple tweak to practice hooking from scratch. Preference bundles could be cleared up greatly, still learning. Honestly I wouldnt download currently, it probably breaks the device

But what I have works. This tweak allows you to edit the rgb values of the outline, body, and bolt of the battery icon on the status bar. As far as I know it works, havent encountered any issues yet 

Feedback is really appreciated. Pretty please
